# k-means_clustering_projects
K-Means Clustering: From Scratch Implementation This project involves building the K-Means clustering algorithm from the ground up using NumPy. By avoiding high-level libraries like scikit-learn for the core logic, you will gain a deep functional understanding of iterative optimization.
